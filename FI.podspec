  s.description      = <<-DESC
A detected rectangle feature is not necessarily rectangular in the plane of the image; rather, the feature identifies a shape that may be rectangular in space but which appears in perspective in the imageâ€”for example, a paper or book on a desk. The properties of a CIRectangleFeature object identify its corners in image coordinates.
